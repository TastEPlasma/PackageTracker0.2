Version 1.0
Working Installer located at PackageTracker\PackageTrackerSetup\Release

//Introduction
This program is called Package Tracker.
It was written by Erick R. Webster.

//Program
This program is written in C#, and compiled
under Visual Studio Pro 2013.  
It uses Windows Presentation Forms for the GUI.  
It uses Entity Framework 6.0 in order to store 
data locally in a SQL database.  
It uses the web API made publicly available by
FedEx, UPS, and the USPS.

//Purpose
This program was written with the smaller distibutor
in mind, such as an ebay or etsy seller.  It is of course
applicable to anyone who ships or even receives a great
deal of packages.  It enables the user to continously
monitor the status of all shipments at a glance.  It also
allows the user to specify their own credenitals for
logging in to the Web Services listed above.  

//Rights
This program is free for all uses, commercial and private.
All other rights reserved, where applicable..

***IMPORTANT NOTE***
The program uses a set of dummy accounts in order to check
the status of packages.  However, FedEx IS NOT SUPPORTED "out of 
the box".  This is because signing up required legitimate
business credentials and a corporate credit card, which I 
did not possess.  If I can find a work around for this situation,
I will update the program and this ReadMe.
